# BW Save Screen
BW Save Script updated to v21.1

I updated the [BW Save Screen](https://reliccastle.com/resources/460/) from HDrawer and shiney570. Cleaned up the code, changed the pictures folder and changed the text position.

Inside 'BWSaveSettings.rb' there are two options:
* 'BGSTYLE' lets you choose between Black and White screen ('0') or Black 2 and Whote 2 ('1').
* 'CLOCK' allows you to show the time on the center left of the screen; 'true' to show it, 'false' to hide.
