# BW Save Screen
BW Save Script updated to v21.1

I updated the [BW Save Screen](https://reliccastle.com/resources/460/) from HDrawer and shiney570. Cleaned up the code, changed the pictures folder and changed the text position.

## How to Install
[Download the file](https://github.com/abacaxi-queer/BW-Save-Screen/releases/download/v1.2/BW.Save.Screen.zip) and copy all the folders to the root Essentials folder, then run the game.

## How to Customize
Inside `BWSaveSettings.rb` there are two options:
* `BGSTYLE` lets you choose between Black and White screen (`0`) or Black 2 and Whote 2 (`1`).
* `CLOCK` allows you to show the time on the top center of the screen; `true` to show it, `false` to hide.
